# HeroSearch
### Heroscape companion app used to search characters and create armies.
- Coroutines / Flow / StateFlow
    - Coroutines launched with exception handling by default
        - App does not fail on any coroutine failure
    - Flows launched with proper scope
        - Will cancel when either fragment or view model is stopped
        - Will continue past fragment or view model as needed
- Data handling
    - Data layer
        - Data mappers are used to transform remote data to domain data
    - View model layer
        - User input data is asynchronously validated before acceptance
            - Must be correct length, type (text, number, email), min-max (number), nullable
        - Local data is requested from Room database and transformed to adapter lists
        - Requests are asynchronously started via base UseCase class
            - Handles errors automatically
            - Posts on main thread, executes outside main thread
            - Takes scope to run only when needed
        - Results from requests are returned as Either left (failure) or right (success)
        - Failures organized by feature:
            - Database failures
            - Firebase failures
            - Firestore failures
            - Data validation failures
    - UI layer
        - User input data that is not valid will show errors and not allow submission
            - Errors are immediate and update with each user character entry
        - Contains base classes that share results handling code
            - Results can be ignored, shown to user, retried
        - ViewBinding is used to interact with layouts
- UI
    - Uses .xml to create UI
    - UI notifications
        - Shows snackbars to user on certain actions
        - Can show toasts to user
    - Text manipulation
        - Creates hyperlinks in text that user can click
        - Creates links in text that go to different part of app
        - Changes text size, bold, italicized, etc.
    - Animations
        - Uses animations to "scale up" search results from top to bottom
        - Fragment transitions use animations to slide in and out
        - Android material library used to show interactions with buttons
        - Xml animation lists are used to combine and animate individual xml vector files
        - Icons can change picture depending on current selection state

        - State lists are used to automatically change button/other colors upon state changes
        - Colors are applied to most views automatically through styles xml
    - Multiple unique vector icons created and converted to xml
    - Background shapes with colors created to improve aesthetics
    - FAB
        - Enhanced FAB button that expands to display more FAB options
    - Navigation drawer
        - Additionally uses Android navigation component for fragment navigation
    - Top app bar
        - Includes tab layout
        - Uses options menu in app bar
    - Popup menus used for different features
    - Dialog fragments are used for adding/editing data
    - Army creator
        - Users can select characters and add/remove them from personal army
        - Users can swipe through each character in the army
            - Bottom navigation can be used to view different parts of a specific character
    - Extensive SQLite search functionality
        - Created unique SQL "SELECT" search creator for enhanced user searches
        - User can search over 60 different fields
        - Searches can use the following operators:
            - contains          - does not contain
            - equal to          - not equal to
            - greater than      - not greater than
            - less than         - not less than
            - between           - not between
        - Results can be sorted by multiple fields in alphabetical and reverse order
        - The results View layout can be changed between two different options
        - RecyclerView with paging data is used to handle results more efficiently
    - Character view
        - Four different bottom navigation tabs are used to display a character
        - A picture tab is used to display a picture of the character card
            - The card can be stored locally or is fetched from url using Glide
            - Url fetched images are cached
            - Users can change the default picture type they want displayed
        - A random dice roll is displayed via a bottom sheet dialog fragment
            - Allows D6 and D20 dice rolls
            - The specific character values are used for dice quantities, but can be adjusted
            - Dice rolls are saved and can be reset
- Storage
    - Local storage
        - Preference manager
            - Saves and edits user preferences
            - Uses kotlin serialization to store personal user SQL search text
        - Room database / SQLite
